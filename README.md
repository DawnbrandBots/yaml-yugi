# YAML Yugi

This project aims to create a comprehensive, machine-readable, human-editable database of the _Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card
Game_ and _Official Card Game_. It is currently incomplete and a work-in-progress.

YAML Yugi is the primary data source for the new version Discord bot [Bastion](https://github.com/DawnbrandBots/bastion-bot).

Most card text is &copy; Studio Dice/SHUEISHA, TV TOKYO, KONAMI.
