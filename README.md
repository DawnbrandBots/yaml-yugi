# YAML Yugi

This project aims to create a comprehensive, machine-readable, human-editable database of the _Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card
Game_ and _Official Card Game_. It is currently incomplete and a work-in-progress.

YAML Yugi is the primary data source for the new version of Discord bot [Bastion](https://github.com/DawnbrandBots/bastion-bot).

Most card text is &copy; Studio Dice/SHUEISHA, TV TOKYO, KONAMI. They can be found under [`/data`](/data)
and on the [`aggregate`](https://github.com/DawnbrandBots/yaml-yugi/tree/aggregate) branch.

The remaining files — the actual source code of this stage of the pipeline — are available under the
GNU Affero General Public License 3.0 or later. See [COPYING](./COPYING) for more details.
