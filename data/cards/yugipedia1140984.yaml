    For a Synchro Summon, you can substitute this card for any 1 "Synchron" Tuner. You can only use each of the following effects of "Scrap Synchron" once per turn. If you Synchro Summon a monster that mentions a "Synchron" Tuner as material, this card in your hand can also be used as material. If a monster(s) that mentions "Junk Warrior", and/or a Synchro Monster(s) with "Warrior" in its original name, that you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish this card from your field or GY instead.
