    If this card has a "Zubaba", "Gagaga", "Gogogo", or "Dododo" card as material: You can detach 1 material from this card; add 1 "Gagaga", "Onomat", or "Xyz" card from your Deck to your hand. You can only use this effect of "Gagagaga Girl" once per turn. A "Utopic Future" Xyz Monster that has this card as material gains this effect.
    ● If it is Xyz Summoned: Activate this effect; it can make a second attack during each Battle Phase this turn.
