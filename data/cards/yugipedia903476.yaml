    If your opponent has a monster on their field and/or in their GY, and you control a WATER monster: You can take 1 "Icejade" monster from your Deck, and either send it to the GY or Special Summon it. If a face-up "Icejade" monster you control leaves the field by an opponent's card, except by being destroyed (and except during the Damage Step): You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 card your opponent controls; banish it. You can only use each effect of "Great Icejade Manifestation" once per turn.
