    Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Must be Special Summoned (from your hand or GY) by paying half your LP while your opponent has a Monster Card on their field or GY with an effect that activates in the hand or Monster Zone in response to a card or effect activation. You can only Special Summon "Liberator Etho" once per turn this way. This card's Special Summon cannot be negated. While this card is in the Monster Zone, it cannot be used as material for a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Summon, also it is unaffected by monster effects activated on your opponent's field during your turn only.
