    Toss a coin and apply this effect. If "Light Barrier" is in your Field Zone, you can choose the effect instead.
    ● Heads: Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower "Arcana Force" monster from your Deck.
    ● Tails: Special Summon 1 monster from your GY that has a coin tossing effect.
    You can banish this card from your GY; add 1 card from your GY to your hand that has a coin tossing effect. You can only use 1 "Arcana Spread" effect per turn, and only once that turn.
