    Went to EDO-FRONT, which is the talk of town. The Tempura here is not only massive in scale, but its beautiful appearance has earned it the nickname "Kinpura". Although the port is filled with the latest state-of-the-art facilities and has a cross-cultural feel to it, the air is filled with a rich aroma that evokes a certain sense of nostalgia, and the occasional crackling and popping sound echoes through the air, lifting one's spirits. Although I had long awaited this Tempura, the rough conditions in the surrounding airspace meant it could not enter the port today. Due to my poor luck, I had to hand in a practically blank report. It's really regrettable as I've been looking forward to this for over a year, but I think at the end of the day I'll give this 3 stars.

    You can target 1 card in your Pendulum Zone; toss a coin and if the result is heads, Special Summon it, or if the result is tails, destroy it, and if you do, you lose LP equal to its Pendulum Scale x 300. You can only use this effect of "Tempura of Chance - EBI" once per turn.
