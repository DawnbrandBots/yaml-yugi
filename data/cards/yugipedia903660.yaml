    If a card(s) on the field is destroyed by card effect and "Visas Starfrost" is on the field: You can Special Summon this card from your hand, then you can add 1 "Clear New World" from your Deck or GY to your hand. If another monster(s) in your possession is destroyed by card effect: You can target 1 monster your opponent controls; destroy it, and if you do, this card gains ATK equal to that monster's original ATK until the end of this turn. You can only use each effect of "Veda Karantha" once per turn.
