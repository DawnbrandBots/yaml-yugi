    You can activate this card the turn it was Set, by revealing 1 other Set Trap you control. When a Spell/Trap Card is activated: Activate 1 of these effects;
    ● Pay 1500 LP; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card, and if you do that, for the rest of this turn, neither player can activate cards, or the effects of cards, with its same original name.
    ● Pay 3000 LP; negate the activation, and if you do, banish that card, then your opponent banishes all cards with its same original name from their hand and Deck.
