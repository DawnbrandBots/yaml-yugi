    When this card is activated: You can target 1 Level 6 or lower Insect monster in your GY; Special Summon it. You can reveal 1 Insect monster in your hand, then target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls and 1 Insect monster you control with lower ATK than the revealed monster; switch control of both monsters, and if you do, the monster you took control of becomes an Insect monster. You can only use 1 "Giant Ballshoot" effect per turn, and only once that turn.
