    If your opponent controls a card, you can activate this card from your hand. When a card or effect is activated that includes an effect that adds a card(s) from the Deck to the hand: Negate that effect, then, if you have a Trap in your GY, destroy that negated card. You cannot activate DARK, WATER, and FIRE monster effects for the rest of this Duel after this card activated from the hand resolves. You can only activate 1 "Dominus Purge" per turn.
