    During your turn, if a Synchro Monster(s) was sent to your GY this turn: Target 1 Synchro Monster you control; it gains the ability this turn to make a second attack during each Battle Phase, then, if you activated this card by targeting a Synchro Monster with "Warrior", "Synchron", and/or "Stardust" in its original name, you can make it gain ATK equal to the ATK of 1 Synchro Monster in your GY. You can only activate 1 "Final Cross" per turn.
