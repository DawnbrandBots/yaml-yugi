    While your opponent controls a monster, "Rescue-ACE" monsters you control gain 500 ATK/DEF. During your Main Phase, you can Normal Summon 1 "Rescue-ACE" monster in addition to your Normal Summon/Set. (You can only gain this effect once per turn.) Once per turn: You can target 4 of your "Rescue-ACE" cards that are banished and/or in your GY; shuffle them into the Deck, then draw 1 card.
