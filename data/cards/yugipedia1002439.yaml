    During your Main Phase: You can destroy 1 DARK monster in your hand or face-up field, and if you do, add 1 "Yubel", or 1 card that mentions it except "Nightmare Pain", from your Deck to your hand. You can only use this effect of "Nightmare Pain" once per turn. While you control a "Yubel" monster, all your opponent's monsters that can attack must attack a "Yubel" monster. Your opponent takes any battle damage you would have taken from battles involving your "Yubel" monsters instead.
