    The activation of this card, or its effects, cannot be negated, nor can its effects be negated. Special Summon 1 "Slifer the Sky Dragon" from your GY, then each player draws until they have 6 cards in their hand. You can banish this card from your GY; place 1 "Monster Reborn" from your Deck or GY on top of your Deck, then, if a Divine-Beast monster is in your GY, draw 1 card. You can only use each effect of "The Revived Sky God" once per turn.
