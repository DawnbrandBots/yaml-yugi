    Excavate the top 5 cards of your opponent's Deck, and if you do, choose 1 excavated card and declare a multiple of 100 (max. 3000). Your opponent can gain that much LP, and if they do, you lose that much LP, and if you do, add the chosen card to your hand, also place the rest on top of the Deck in the same order. Otherwise, place the excavated cards on top of the Deck in the same order.
