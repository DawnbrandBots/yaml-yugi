The Tempura here is not only massive in scale, but its beautiful appearance has earned it the nickname \"Kinpura\". Although the port is filled with the latest state-of-the-art facilities and has a cross-cultural feel to it, the air is filled with a rich aroma that evokes a certain sense of nostalgia, and the occasional crackling and popping sound echoes through the air, lifting one's spirits. Although I had long awaited this Tempura, the rough conditions in the surrounding airspace meant it could not enter the port today. Due to my poor luck, I had to hand in a practically blank report. It's really regrettable as I've been looking forward to this for over a year but I think at the end of the day I'll give this 3 stars.", "de": null, "es": null, "fr": null, "it": null, "pt": null, "ja": null, "ko": null, "zh-TW": null, "zh-CN": null}, "card_type": "Monster", "monster_type_line": "Aqua / Pendulum / Normal", "attribute": "FIRE", "level": 3, "atk": 1600, "def": 0, "pendulum_scale": 8, "pendulum_effect": {"en": "You can target 1 card in your Pendulum Zone; toss a coin and if the result is heads, Special Summon it, or if the result is tails, destroy it, and if you do, you lose LP equal to its Pendulum Scale x 300.
