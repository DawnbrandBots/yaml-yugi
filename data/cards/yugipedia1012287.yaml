    When this card is activated: You can add 1 Fish monster that has an effect to treat itself as a Tuner, from your Deck to your hand. Once per turn, if your "White Aura" monster attacked, at the end of a Damage Step: You can activate this effect; the attacking monster can make a second attack in a row. Once per turn, if a Level 8 or higher Fish Synchro Monster(s) is Special Summoned from your GY (even during the Damage Step): You can destroy all monsters your opponent controls. You can only activate 1 "White Reincarnation" per turn.
