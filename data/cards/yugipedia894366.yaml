    If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can excavate the top 3 cards of your Deck, and if you do, you can add 1 excavated "Purery" Spell/Trap to your hand, also place the rest on the bottom of the Deck in any order. Once per turn: You can reveal 1 "Purery" Quick-Play Spell in your hand, and if you do, Special Summon 1 Xyz Monster that mentions it from your Extra Deck, by using this face-up card you control as material, and if you do, attach the revealed card to the Summoned monster as additional material. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon.)
