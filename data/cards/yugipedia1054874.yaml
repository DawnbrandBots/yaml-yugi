    Activate only if you do not control a face-up card in your Field Zone. You can target 1 Field Spell that is banished or in either GY; destroy this card, and if you do, place that targeted card face-up in your Field Zone. You can only use this effect of "Multi-Universe" once per turn. If a card(s) in the Field Zone would be destroyed by card effect, you can banish this card from your GY instead.
