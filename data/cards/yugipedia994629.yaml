    Once per turn: You can declare 1 card type (Monster/Spell/Trap); each player reveals the bottom card of their Deck, and if they reveal a card of the declared type, they add it to their hand. Otherwise, they place it on the top of the Deck. If this face-up card in its owner's Spell & Trap Zone is destroyed by an opponent's card effect: You can make your opponent place 1 card from their hand on the bottom of the Deck.
