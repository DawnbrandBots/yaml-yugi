    You can discard 1 card, then target 1 monster your opponent controls that has a Level; roll a six-sided die and apply this effect based on the result.
    ● Higher than the targeted monster's Level: Destroy the targeted monster, then you can add 1 monster with the same original Level from your Deck to your hand, also you cannot activate the effect of "Shateki" for the rest of this turn.
    ● Equal to or lower than that targeted monster's Level: Reduce the targeted monster's Level by 1.
