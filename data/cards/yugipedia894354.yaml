    Each player gains 1000 LP, then you can discard 1 card, and if you do, Special Summon 1 Level 1 "Purery" monster from your Deck. A "Purery" Xyz Monster that has this card as material gains this effect.
    ● Once per turn: You can send 1 other card you control to the GY, then target 1 card your opponent controls; attach it to this card as material.
