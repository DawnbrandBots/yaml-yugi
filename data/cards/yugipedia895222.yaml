    (This card is always treated as a "Galaxy" card.)
    When an opponent's monster declares an attack: You can discard this card; Special Summon 1 "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" from your hand or Deck, then change the attack target to it, then you can attach this card from your GY to 1 Xyz Monster on the field as material. If a "Photon" and/or "Galaxy" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect, you can banish this card from your GY instead.
