    Cannot be destroyed by your opponent's card effects while "Multi-Universe" is on the field. You can only use each of the following effects of "Krishnerd Witch" once per turn. If a card(s) in the Field Zone leaves the field by card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand. When a Field Spell that is already face-up on the field activates its effect (Quick Effect): You can shuffle 1 of your monsters that is banished or in your GY into the Deck, or if that monster mentions that Field Spell, you can Special Summon it instead.
