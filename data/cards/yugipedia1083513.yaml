    2 Level 1 monsters
    Your non-Xyz "Mimighoul" monsters can attack directly while your opponent controls a face-down monster. You can only use each of the following effects of "Giant Mimighoul" once per turn. If this card is Xyz Summoned: You can add 1 "Mimighoul" card from your Deck to your hand. You can detach 1 material from this card, then target face-up cards on the field up to the number of face-down monsters your opponent controls; destroy them, and if you do, inflict 1000 damage to your opponent for each card destroyed.
