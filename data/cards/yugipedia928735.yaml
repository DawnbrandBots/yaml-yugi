    If you control "Crystal Skull", "Ashoka Pillar", and "Cabrera Stone": Destroy all cards on the field, also, this turn, your opponent takes any effect damage you would have taken instead. You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 "Crystal Skull", 1 "Ashoka Pillar", and 1 "Cabrera Stone" in your GY; shuffle them into the Deck, then draw 3 cards. You can only use 1 "Triangle O" effect per turn, and only once that turn.
