    You can target any number of face-up monsters on the field, and declare 1 Type or Attribute; they become that Type or Attribute. If a monster(s) is Special Summoned to your opponent's field, while this card is in your Monster Zone (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 monster on each field with the same Type and Attribute from each other; return them to the hand. You can only use each effect of "Shipping Archfiend" once per turn.
