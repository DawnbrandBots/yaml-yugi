    An alien lifeform that suddenly crash-landed from the heavens far above. Although many researchers have tried to determine why it came, the combination of its luminous glow and the miasma that surrounds it have long shrouded its existence in complete mystery. As a result, trying to grasp the whole picture has been extremely difficult. However, in recent years, thanks to the efforts of up-and-coming researchers, many new species have been discovered. The day will soon come when the full extent of their existence will be revealed.
