    Pay half your LP, then target 1 Normal Trap in your opponent's GY, except "Transaction Rollback"; this effect becomes that Normal Trap's effect when that card is activated. You can banish this card from your GY and pay half your LP, then target 1 Normal Trap in your GY, except "Transaction Rollback"; this effect becomes that Normal Trap's effect when that card is activated. You can only use 1 "Transaction Rollback" effect per turn, and only once that turn.
