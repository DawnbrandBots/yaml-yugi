    During your Main Phase, you can Normal Summon 1 "Tistina" monster, in addition to your Normal Summon/Set. (You can only gain this effect once per turn.) You can target 1 face-up monster you control, or if you control a LIGHT "Tistina" monster, you can target 1 face-up monster on the field instead; change that monster to face-down Defense Position, then add 1 "Tistina" card from your Deck to your hand, except "Breath of the Tistina". You can only use this effect of "Breath of the Tistina" once per turn.
