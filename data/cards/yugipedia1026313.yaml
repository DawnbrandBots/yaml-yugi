When your opponent activates a card or effect (Quick Effect): You can send this card Summoned by its own effect to the GY; send 1 card with the same name as that opponent's card from your Deck or Extra Deck to the GY, and if you do, negate the activation. You can only use each effect of "Mirah and Matchnoko" once per turn.
