    If you control no cards (Quick Effect): You can discard this card; apply these effects this turn.
    ● Each time your opponent Special Summons a monster(s) from the Deck and/or Extra Deck, immediately draw 1 card.
    ● Once, during this End Phase, if the number of cards in your hand is more than the number of cards your opponent controls +6, you must randomly shuffle cards from your hand into the Deck so the number in your hand equals the number your opponent controls +6.
    You can only activate 1 other "Mulcharmy" monster effect, the turn you activate this effect.
