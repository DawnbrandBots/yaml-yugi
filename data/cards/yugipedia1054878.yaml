    2 monsters with different names
    You can banish 1 monster from your face-up field or GY with 2000 or less ATK, then target 1 face-up monster on the field; make its ATK become equal to the original ATK of the monster banished to activate this effect (until the end of this turn), then if you banished a monster that was originally Reptile, draw 1 card. You can only use this effect of "Haggard Lizardose" once per turn.
