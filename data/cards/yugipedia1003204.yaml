    During your Main Phase: You can place both this card you control and 1 "Centurion" monster from your hand or Deck, except "Centurion Trudea", face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as Continuous Traps, also you cannot Special Summon "Centurion Trudea" for the rest of this turn. During the Main Phase, while this card is treated as a Continuous Trap: You can Special Summon this card, then you can increase its Level by 4. You can only use each effect of "Centurion Trudea" once per turn.
