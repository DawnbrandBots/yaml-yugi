    Target 1 Level 5 or lower monster you control; you cannot Special Summon for the rest of this turn after this card resolves, except monsters with the same original Type as the targeted monster, also add 1 Level 10 monster with that original Type from your Deck to your hand, then you can apply this effect.
    ● Discard 1 card, and if you do, Special Summon 1 monster with the same Type as the added monster from your hand in Defense Position.
    You can only activate 1 "Double Wild" per turn.
