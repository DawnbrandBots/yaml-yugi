    Target 1 face-up card in the Field Zone; banish it, then place it face-up in the Field Zone of the opponent of the player who controlled it, then you can choose 1 Field Spell with a different original name in the GY of the player who now controls the first card and place it face-up in the Field Zone of the player who controlled the first card when it was banished. You can only activate 1 "Repeated Land Transaction" per turn.
