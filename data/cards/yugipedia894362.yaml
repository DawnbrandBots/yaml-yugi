    You can pay 500 LP; reveal 3 "Purery" cards from your Deck, except "Purery, My Friend", your opponent randomly picks 1 for you to add to your hand, and you shuffle the rest back into the Deck. If a face-up "Purery" Xyz Monster(s) you control leaves the field by an opponent's card (even during the Damage Step): You can add up to 3 "Purery" Quick-Play Spells with different names from your GY to your hand. You can only use each effect of "Purery, My Friend" once per turn.
