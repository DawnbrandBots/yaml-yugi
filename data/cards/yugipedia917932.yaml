    (This card is always treated as a "Rescue-ACE" card.)
    Target 1 "Rescue-ACE" monster you control; until the end of this turn, that monster you control gains 1500 ATK/DEF, it is unaffected by your opponent's monster effects, also the next time it would be destroyed by battle, it is not destroyed. You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 "Rescue-ACE" Spell in your GY; Set it to your field. You can only use this effect of "REINFORCE!" once per turn.
