    If a "Kashtira" Xyz Monster is on the field: Make both players banish monsters from their field face-down so they control only 1. If this card becomes banished: You can target 1 "Kashtira" Xyz Monster you control; add 1 "Kashtira" monster you own attached to it to your hand, then you can Special Summon it from your hand. You can only use each effect of "Kashtira Big Bang" once per turn.
