    If this card is used for the Link Summon of a "Borrel" monster, it is treated as a Dragon monster. You can only use each of the following effects of "Rokket Coder" once per turn. If a Cyberse monster you control would be used as Link Material for a "Code Talker" monster, this card in your hand can also be used as material. If this card you control would be used as Link Material for a "Borrel" monster, you can also use 1 DARK monster in your hand as material.
