    Reveal 2 Flip monsters with different names from your Deck, your opponent randomly picks 1 for you to Special Summon to their field in face-down Defense Position, and you add the other to your hand, then you can Special Summon 1 "Mimighoul" monster from your hand. If your opponent Special Summons a monster(s) (except during the Damage Step): You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 face-down monster your opponent controls, change it to face-up Attack or Defense Position. You can only use 1 "Mimighoul Maker" effect per turn, and only once that turn.
