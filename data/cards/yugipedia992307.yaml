    Target 1 Level 7 or higher Spellcaster monster you control; apply these effects, in sequence.
    ● That face-up monster is unaffected by other monsters' effects this turn, but send it to the GY during the Standby Phase of the next turn.
    ● All face-up monsters your opponent currently controls lose ATK equal to that monster's ATK, then, if any of those monsters' ATK has been reduced to 0 as a result, destroy it.
    You can only activate 1 "Sinful Spoils of Doom - Luciela" per turn.
