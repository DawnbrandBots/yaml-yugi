    If you control a "Gladiator Beast" monster that was Special Summoned from the Deck or Extra Deck, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can only Special Summon "Test Bear" once per turn this way. You can Tribute this card and shuffle 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster from your hand or face-up field into the Deck/Extra Deck; Special Summon up to 2 "Gladiator Beast" monsters from your Deck. (This is treated as a Special Summon by a "Gladiator Beast" monster's effect.) You can only use this effect of "Test Bear" once per turn.
