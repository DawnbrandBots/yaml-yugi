    Your opponent cannot activate the effects of any of their monsters in the same column as this card and/or one of your "Watt" monsters, that activate when they are Normal or Special Summoned. You can target 1 "Watt" monster you control; you cannot Special Summon monsters for the rest of this turn, except Thunder monsters, also Special Summon 1 "Watt" monster with a different name from your Deck, then you lose LP equal to the Summoned monster's ATK. You can only use this effect of "Wattkingdom" once per turn.
