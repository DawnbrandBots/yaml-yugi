    You can Ritual Summon this card with "Dogmatikalamity". Cannot be Ritual Summoned, except with a "Dogmatika" card's effect. "Dogmatika" monsters you control are unaffected by your opponent's activated Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link Monsters' effects. During your Main Phase: You can make your opponent choose 1 of these effects.
    ● Send 1 card from their hand and/or Extra Deck to the GY for every 2 cards in their Extra Deck (their choice).
    ● Return all Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link Monsters they control to the Extra Deck.
    You can only use this effect of "White Zoa of Dogmatika" once per turn.
