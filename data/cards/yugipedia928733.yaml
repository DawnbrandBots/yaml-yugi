    Cyberse Link Monsters you control cannot be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. Once per turn, during the Battle Step, if your monster battles an opponent's monster: You can change that opponent's monster's ATK to 0 (until the end of this turn), and if you do, neither monster can be destroyed by that battle, also neither player takes battle damage from that battle. When your opponent activates a card or effect during the Damage Step while your "Code Talker" monster is attacking: You can banish this card from your GY; negate the activation, and if you do, the attacking monster gains 700 ATK.
