    1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner monsters
    The first time this card would be destroyed by an opponent's card effect each turn, it is not destroyed. Once per opponent's Battle Phase (Quick Effect): You can discard 1 card; this card gains ATK equal to half the total ATK of all other face-up monsters you currently control, then place 1 counter on this card, also your opponent's monsters cannot target monsters for attacks this turn, except this one. If this card with a counter is destroyed by battle: Destroy all monsters you control.
