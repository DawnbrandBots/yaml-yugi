    2 Level 7 monsters
    You can also Xyz Summon this card by using 1 Rank 2 monster you control with 5 or more materials. (Transfer its materials to this card.) This card with 5 or more materials is unaffected by your opponent's activated effects. You can detach 2 materials from this card, then target 1 card your opponent controls or in their GY; place it on the bottom of the Deck. This is a Quick Effect if this card has a Level 1 "Purery" monster as material.
