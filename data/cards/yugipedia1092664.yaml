    "BULLauncher" is a support machine specializing in bombardment and daytime combat that not only has the constantly refined "Coc-OS" and "BFS Armor", but it also has 3 "Foil-Packer" installed within it under orders of "Madera" after repeated trial and error. By installing a "Beef-Rifle" or other armaments, it can be used as medium and long range support for the "Steam Knights" and their operations. Also, "BULLauncher" can be combined with "WINGear" which specializes in high-speed aerial combat and "BOARms", which specializes in melee and assault combat, to cause the high calorie "Steam Jushin - BW" to descend upon this world.
