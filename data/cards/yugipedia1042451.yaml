    During your Main Phase: You can place 1 monster from your hand face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell, then place 1 "Millennium" monster or 1 "Sengenjin" from your Deck face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell. You can only use this effect of "Temple of the Stone Slabs" once per turn. If a face-up "Millennium" monster(s) and/or "Sengenjin" you control is destroyed by battle or card effect, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY.
