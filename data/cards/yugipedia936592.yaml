    ● Take 1 "Volcanic" monster from your Deck, and either add it to your hand or Special Summon it, ignoring its Summoning conditions, but return it to the hand during the End Phase.
    ● Target 1 Pyro monster on the field; inflict damage to your opponent equal to its original ATK. If you targeted a monster you control, the damage inflicted by this effect is halved.
