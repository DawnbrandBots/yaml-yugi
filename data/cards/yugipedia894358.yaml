    Apply this effect to 1 card on the field (until the end of the next turn), then you can discard 1 card, and if you do, Special Summon 1 Level 1 "Purery" monster from your Deck. Once applied, the next time that card would be destroyed by card effect, it is not destroyed. A "Purery" Xyz Monster that has this card as material gains this effect.
    ● This card can attack monsters a number of times each Battle Phase, up to the number of "Purery Happy Memory" attached to it +1.
