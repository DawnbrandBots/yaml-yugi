    If a Tuner(s) is sent to your GY, even during the Damage Step: You can Special Summon this card from your GY (if it was there when the card was sent) or hand (even if not) (but banish it when it leaves the field), then if "Junk Warrior" or another monster that mentions it is on the field, you can change all monsters your opponent controls with 1900 or more ATK to Defense Position, also you cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck for the rest of this turn, except Synchro Monsters. You can only use this effect of "Supersonic Chick" once per turn.
