    Once per turn, you can either: Target 1 Effect Monster you control; equip this card to that target, OR: Unequip this card and Special Summon it. If the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle or card effect, destroy this card instead. You can return this equipped card to the hand; equip 1 banished Union monster to an appropriate monster you control, as if it were equipped by that Union monster's effect, and if you do, Special Summon this card from your hand. You can only use this effect of "Union Pilot" once per turn.
