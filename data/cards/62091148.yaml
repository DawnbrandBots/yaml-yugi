    Target 1 FIRE monster on the field; equip this card to it as an Equip Card that gives it 700 ATK, then you can change 1 Effect Monster on the field to face-down Defense Position. You can banish this card from your GY; Fusion Summon 1 FIRE Warrior or Dragon Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by shuffling its materials from your hand, field, and/or GY into the Deck, but destroy it during the End Phase. You can only use this effect of "Salamandra with Chain" once per turn.
