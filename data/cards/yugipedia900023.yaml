    You can also Xyz Summon "Kshatri-La Ariseheart" once per turn during a turn the effects of "Kshatri-La Shangri-La" are activated, using a "Kshatri-La" monster you control as material. Cards sent to the GY are banished instead. Once per Chain, each time a card(s) is banished: Attach 1 banished card to this card as material. Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can detach 3 materials from this card, then target 1 card on the field; banish that card face-down.
