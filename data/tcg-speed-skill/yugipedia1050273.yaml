    Once per turn, you can banish 1 card from your hand face-down, then place 1 Dig Counter on this skill (max. 1). If a face-up "Fossil" Fusion Monster(s) you control is destroyed by card effect, you can place 1 Dig Counter on this Skill (max. 1). Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can remove 1 Dig Counter from this Skill to Fusion Summon 1 "Fossil" Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by banishing materials mentioned on it from any GYs (except for materials with a specific GY requirement listed.) (This is treated as a Fusion Summon with "Fossil Fusion".)
