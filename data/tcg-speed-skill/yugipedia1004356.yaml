    "Parasite Paracide(s)" on the field cannot be Tributed. If all monsters on the field are Insect monster(s), Level 7 or higher Insect monsters you control can attack directly. Once per Duel, you can discard 1 card, then place 1 "Parasite Paracide" from your GY on top of your opponent's Deck face-up. Treat it as if it were added to their Deck by its effect.
