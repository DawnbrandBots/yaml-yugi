    During your Main Phase, you can Tribute Summon 1 "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" by Tributing 1 Tribute Summoned monster, in addition to your Normal Summon/Set. You can discard 1 Spell, then apply 1 of these Skills (but you can only use each of these Skills once per Duel):
    ● If you control a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", destroy all monsters your opponent controls, also "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" you control cannot declare an attack this turn.
    ● Fusion Summon 1 "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" using monsters from your hand or field as material, and if you do, it is unaffected by your opponent's card effects until the end of this turn.
