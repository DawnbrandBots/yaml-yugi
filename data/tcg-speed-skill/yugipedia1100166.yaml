    While "Dark Necrofear" is face-up on your field, "Destiny Board" and "Spirit Message" cards you control are unaffected by your opponent's card effects. If a "Spirit Message" card would be placed on your field with "Destiny Board", you can Special Summon it as a Normal Monster (Fiend/DARK/Level 1/ATK 0/DEF 0) instead. It cannot be targeted for attacks, but does not prevent your opponent from attacking you directly. Once per turn, you can reveal 1 "Spirit Message" card in your hand and place it on the bottom of the Deck, then draw 1 card.
