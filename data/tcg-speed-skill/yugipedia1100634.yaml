    During your Draw Phase, instead of conducting your normal draw, you may look at the top 2 cards of your Deck, add 1 to your hand, then send the other to the GY. If you do, skip your next Battle Phase. Apply the following Skills:
    ● Only you need 15 or more cards in your GY to activate "Exchange of the Spirit".
    ● If you have 15 or more cards in your GY, you can banish 1 "Exchange of the Spirit" from your GY to activate its effect.
